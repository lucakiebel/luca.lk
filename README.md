# luca.lk

Private Profile/Contact page featuring important information without the clutter of my main home page ( https://luca-kiebel.de )

The files are:
 - `_redirects` file is for cloudflare pages redirects, features links to my socials

 - `id` is my public SSH Key, mostly for setting up server access easier ( `curl -L luc a.lk/id >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` )

 - `lucakiebel.vcf` is a vCard of my contact information, this can be used for smaller QR codes with my information as a contact in it
